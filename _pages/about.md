# Yutai Sun (孙宇泰)

[Email](mailto:ytsun@seu.edu.cn) / [Google Scholar](#) / [GitHub](#) / [LinkedIn](#)

I am currently a **Direct-PhD student** at the School of Information Science and Engineering, **Southeast University (SEU)**, Nanjing, China, advised by [Prof. Chuan Zhang](https://example.com). I am also a University Research Intern at **Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML)**.

My research focuses on the intersection of **AI and Wireless Communications**, with a particular emphasis on the automatic optimization of baseband design spaces for 6G and the development of efficient detection/decoding algorithms.
