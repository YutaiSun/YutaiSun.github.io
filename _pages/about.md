# Yutai Sun

[Email](mailto:ytsun@seu.edu.cn) / [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=py6-mxAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) / [GitHub](https://github.com/YutaiSun) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yutai-sun-615223297/)

I am currently a **Direct-PhD student** at the School of Information Science and Engineering, **Southeast University (SEU)**, Nanjing, China, advised by Prof. Chuan Zhang. I am also a University Research Intern at **Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML)**.

My research focuses on the intersection of **AI and Wireless Communications**, with a particular emphasis on the automatic optimization of baseband design spaces for 6G and the development of efficient detection/decoding algorithms.
